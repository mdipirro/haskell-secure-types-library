# Ensuring Information Security by Using Haskell's Advanced Type System
Library presented in **Ensuring Information Security by Using Haskell's Advanced Type System**. 

*Security* contains the actual library implementation and has no dependencies. *Src* contains an application example as described in the paper. It depends on [`aeson`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson), [`aeson-pretty`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-pretty) and [`text`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text). For running the application you should start `Main.hs`.
